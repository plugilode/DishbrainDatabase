  "description": "Alex Graves is a distinguished Research Scientist at DeepMind, known for his groundbreaking work in neural networks and machine learning. He developed the connectionist time classification (CTC) for neural networks, which was later adopted by Google for voice recognition. With a PhD in AI from IDSIA and a background in Theoretical Physics from Edinburgh University, Graves has made significant contributions to the field of artificial intelligence, particularly in recurrent neural networks and deep learning.",
